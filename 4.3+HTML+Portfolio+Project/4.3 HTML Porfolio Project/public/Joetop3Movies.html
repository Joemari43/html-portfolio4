<h3>Venom</h3>
<p>Venom is a fictional character primarily voiced by Tom Hardy appearing in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Introduced in Venom (2018), Venom is depicted as a symbiote who binds with human investigative journalist Eddie Brock after landing on Earth, with the duo subsequently becoming a vigilante jointly known by Venom's name, and later as the Lethal Protector, facing Venom's former team leader, Riot, and later his son, Carnage, in combat. They are the second incarnation of the character in film, after Topher Grace and Tobey Maguire's respective portrayals of Eddie Brock / Venom and a symbiote-enveloped Spider-Man in Spider-Man 3 (2007).</p>
<p>As of 2022, the character has appeared in three films: Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), and an uncredited cameo appearance in the web series Chen's Market and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Spider-Man: No Way Home (both 2021). Hardy will reprise his role in a third film. While Hardy's portrayal of the character in Venom was met with a mixed critical reception, the chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom received praise.</p>
